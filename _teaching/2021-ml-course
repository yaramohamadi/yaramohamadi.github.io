Created over 2 hours of tutorials on Machine Learning with Python in Persian language with Hands-On exercises. The tutorial covered the basics of machine learning, the primary methods and models of classification and regression, and dimensionality reduction. I published the videos on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgw1zjj8fyc&list=PL2_W-QFuPimVkqWnFnSf-kOWtrGs1avpO) and the codes on [Github](https://github.com/yaramohamadi/Machine_Learning_intro).
