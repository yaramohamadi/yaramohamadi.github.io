I recently obtained a Masters degree in Artificial Intelligence at the [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en) in Iran. There I worked as a research assistant in the Machine Learning Lab under the supervision of [Dr. Amin Sadeghi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Viogmi8AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) on foundational deep learning subjects in the applications of vision. My Master's thesis was titled "When and where to perform regularization in the training of deep learning models?". I obtained my Bachelor's degree from the [Isfahan University of Technology](http://english.iut.ac.ir/) where I studied Computer Engineering. My research interests include but are not limited to **Trustworthiness (especially Explainability, Privacy, and Fairness), Foundational and theoretical DL/ML, Generalization in different scenarios like Multi-Modal/Cross-domain/Zero-shot and Computer Vision broadly**. My short-term goal is to gain more theoretical knowledge by pursuing a Ph.D. in Machine Learning and my long term vision is to bridge the gap between the cutting edge research done in the academia and industrial applications.
