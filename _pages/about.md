I am currently a Masters student studying Artificial Intelligence at the [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en) in Iran, where I work as a research assistant in the Machine Learning Lab under the supervision of [Dr. Amin Sadeghi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Viogmi8AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). I obtained my Bachelor's degree from the [Isfahan University of Technology](http://english.iut.ac.ir/) where I studied Computer Engineering. My research interests include but are not limited to **ML & DL Theory, Trustworthy ML (Explainability, Robustness, and Fairness), and Causal Inference**. My long-term goals are to gain more theoretical knowledge by pursuing a Ph.D. in Machine Learning, and to apply my knowledge in the industry.
