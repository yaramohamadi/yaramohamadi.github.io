### Bio

I am currently a first year PhD student at École de technologie supérieure, Montréal. There, I working on Deep Learning in Vision applications. My focus, more specifically is am working on Generative Domain Adaptation in Few-Shot and Multimodal settings.

Previously, I obtained a Masters degree in Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en) in Iran. There I worked as a research assistant in the Machine Learning (ML) Lab under the supervision of [Dr. Amin Sadeghi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Viogmi8AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) on foundational Deep Learning (DL) and explainability in vision applications. My Master's thesis was titled "When and where to perform regularization in the training of deep learning models?". I obtained my Bachelor's degree from the [Isfahan University of Technology](http://english.iut.ac.ir/) where I studied Computer Engineering.

### Research Interests

My research interests broadly include **Trustworthiness (Privacy, Fairness, Robustness and Explainability)** of **ML/DL** models both **Statistically** and **Causally** within **Vision** and other applications. Thus, I
am naturally driven by the desire to address research questions that arise from the connection of these
subjects. Particular settings that interest me are Cross-Domain Generalization, Low-Supervision,
Multi-Modality, Generative Modeling, and more.

### Aspirations

What I love about this line of work is not only its foundation in how we perceive and trust our algorithms, but also the direct impact it can have on society. I firmly believe that the importance of Trustworthy ML will continue to grow in
the coming years. Thus, there will be an increasing need for experts in the industry. As a result, I aspire to deepen my knowledge in the subject through a PhD to later pursue a related academic career with a focus on solving real-world problems.
